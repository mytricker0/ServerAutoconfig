# ServerAutoconfig

This repository contains a simple installation script for configuring a server with zsh, oh-my-zsh, the Powerlevel10k theme, Docker and Docker Compose.

## Usage

Run the script:

```bash
./install.sh
```

Or run the Oh My Zsh installer directly in one line:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

The script requires sudo privileges to install packages.
